The cohort included 14 929 251 patients (median age 41 years [IQR 25–59]; 7 461 565 [50·0%] of whom were women), who were followed between March 1 and Dec 10, 2020. We aimed to compare: (1) the UK-wide incidence of type 2 diabetes; (2) the frequency of HbA1c testing; and (3) mortality in people with type 2 diabetes, by nation, before and after the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, which began in March 23, 2020 (appendix pp 1–3). There were 790 377 (5·3%) people with type 2 diabetes in the cohort (median age 67 years (IQR 57–76); 348 515 (44·1%) of whom were women).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Matthew J Carr, Alison K Wright, Lalantha Leelarantha, Hood Thabit, Nicola Milne, Naresh Kanumilli, Darren M Ashcroft, Martin K Rutter, Impact of COVID-19 on diagnoses, monitoring, and mortality in people with type 2 diabetes in the UK.
