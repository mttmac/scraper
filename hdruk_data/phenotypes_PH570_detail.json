The overall crude rate of AKI was 6.4/1,000 person years at risk (95% CI 6.30 to 6.50) but varied from 1.63 (1.43 to 1.86) to 662.53 (538.98 to 814.40) depending on, age, comorbidities, and other prescribed drugs. The adjusted RR of AKI during time exposed to ACEI/ARB compared to time unexposed was 1.18 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.23) which was attenuated to 1.12 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.17) after adjustment for non-thiazide diuretic therapy. There was an interaction for the risk of AKI between people using loop diuretics and ACEI/ARB. For those taking loop diuretics, the adjusted RR of AKI during time exposed to ACEI/ARB compared to time unexposed was 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.06) but it was 1.18 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.24) among people not-exposed to loop diuretics (p<0.001).\n\n\nConclusions: \n\nTreatment with ACEI/ARB alone appears to be associated with a small increase in the rate of AKI which is largely seen among people with low absolute risk of AKI. Among people requiring loop diuretics, who have a high absolute risk of AKI, treatment with ACEI/ARB had no measurable association with AKI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Kethryn E Mansfield, Dorothea Nitsch, Liam Smeeth, Krishnan Bhaskaram, Laurie A Tomlinson, Renin-angiostensin system blockage and risk of acute kidney injury. 2015."],"concepts":[{"name":"Acute Kidney Injury - Primary Care","concept_id":"C1969","concept_version_id":5076,"coding_system":"ICD10 codes","codes":[{"code":"N14","description":"Drug- and heavy-metal-induced tubulo-interstitial and tubular conditions","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N14.1","description":"Nephropathy induced by other drugs, medicaments and biological substances","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N14.2","description":"Nephropathy induced by unspecified drug, medicament or biological substance","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17","description":"Acute renal failure","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17.0","description":"Acute renal failure with tubular necrosis","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17.1","description":"Acute renal failure with acute cortical necrosis","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17.2","description":"Acute renal failure with medullary necrosis","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17.8","description":"Other acute renal failure","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N17.9","description":"Acute renal failure, unspecified","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N19","description":"Unspecified kidney failure","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"N99.0","description":"Postprocedural renal failure","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"R34","description":"Anuria and oliguria","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"},{"code":"R94.4","description":"Abnormal results of kidney function studies","Entity type":"res30: Acute kidney injury","Category":"diagnostic","Coding System (ICD-10)":"ICD-10"}]}],"versions":[{"version_id":1140,"version_name":"Acute Kidney Injury","version_date":"2021-10-06T16:25:11.671496Z","is_published":true,"is_latest":true}]}]
