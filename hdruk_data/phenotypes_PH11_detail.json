Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.\n\n\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis of COPD, COPD should be suspected in patients over 35 years old who have a risk factor (typically smoking) and at least one symptom. It is therefore recommended that these codes are only utilised in an adult population at least 35 years old with a history of smoking.\n\n\nhttps://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng115/chapter/Recommendations#diagnosing-copd\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValidation of Read Codes for the Identification of COPD in CPRD\n\n\"Quint et al. validated a set of Read codes for the identification of COPD in CPRD in 2014. Using diagnostic codes alone, the positive predictive value (PPV) was 86.5% (77.5?92.3%). Requiring a diagnostic code, spirometry measures, and specific medication increased PPV to 89.4% (80.7?94.5%) but reduced\ncase numbers by 10%.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"https://portal.caliberresearch.org/phenotypes/axson-COPD-Y9JxuQRFPprJDMHSPowJYs","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"   PhenoFlow Implementation: https://kclhi.org/phenoflow/phenotype/download/37","publications":["Publications in 2019 using validated Read codes from Quint et al. 2014","D.
