These codes are not intended to be mandatory, but are to be used as a starting point for the identification of pneumonia in routine EHR. Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required. \n\n \n\nDefining a community-acquired pneumonia occurrence in CPRD and HES, Millett et al. 2013 used the following algorithm:\n\n1) Pneumonia records wtihin 28 days of each other were considered to be separate consultations for the same illness\n\n2) First record of pneumonia was the index date\n\n3) End of a pneumonia occurrence was defined as 28 days after the last pneumonia code within the illness episode\n\n4) In HES, pneumonia coded as the primary diagnosis on the first day of a hospital admission\n\n \n\nDefining a hospital-acquired pneumonia occurrence in HES and CPRD, Millett et al. 2013 used the following algorithm:\n\n1) Pneumonia coded at any time beyond the first day of a hospital admission\n\n2) Using CPRD in conjunction with HES, pneumonia coded in CPRD within 14 days of a hospital admission (for any cause) was deemed hospital-acquired\n\n3) In CPRD, use of a hospital-acquired pneumonia code at any time during the pneumonia occurrence\n\n \n\nMillett, E.

PMID: 32603361; PMCID: PMC7326238.\n\n \n\nDefining a hospital-acquired respiratory infection including pneumonia occcurence using ICD-10 codes, Reynurn et al. 2020 used the following algorithm:\n\n1) all-cause pneumonia (which is highly sensitive but not specific), and three clinical definitions based on WHO definitions of severe or very severe pneumonia, hypoxic pneumonia (which indicates severe disease and is the main cause for pneumonia-associated death), and radiological pneumonia\n\n2) All-cause pneumonia included ICD-10 codes J10·0–18·9, J21, and J22. Bronchiolitis (ICD-10 code J21) was included because clinicians in Fiji code pneumonia according to Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses definitions (cough and breathing rate, according to age) and this includes bronchiolitis.\n\n3) Severe or very severe pneumonia was based on the WHO 2005 pneumonia case definitions10 with the addition of oxygen saturation of less than 90% in room air, or death due to pneumonia (confirmed by a pathologist at autopsy). \n\n4) Hypoxic pneumonia was defined as any child with pneumonia and oxygen saturation of less than 90% in room air, or death due to pneumonia.\n\n5) Radiological pneumonia was defined as primary endpoint consolidation according to the WHO 2005 standard case definition as re-read by a paediatric radiologist (MdC). Individuals with pneumonia who died from pneumonia before having a chest radiograph taken were also classified as having radiological pneumonia.\n\n \n\nReyburn R, Tuivaga E, Nguyen CD, Ratu FT, Nand D, Kado J, Tikoduadua L, Jenkins K, de Campo M, Kama M, Devi R, Rafai E, Weinberger DM, Mulholland EK, Russell FM.
