Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.  \n\n \n\nAccording to  the National Health Service (NHS), whooping cough (also called pertussis) is a bacterial infection of the lungs and breathing tubes. It causes repeated coughing bouts that can last for two to three months or more, and can make babies and young children in particular very ill. The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as a runny nose, red and watery eyes, a sore throat, and a slightly raised temperature. Intense coughing bouts start about a week later.\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/whooping-cough/\n\nhttps://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/whooping-cough\n\n \n\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines,  Whooping cough, also known as pertussis, is a highly infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. It is spread by aerosol droplets released during coughing, and disproportionately affects infants and young children. The incubation period of whooping cough is usually about 7 days, and the person is infectious for 3 weeks after the onset of symptoms.\n\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/whooping-cough/\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["Publications in 2020-2021 identified in PubMed","Sturkenboom M, Braeye T, van der Aa L, Danieli G, Dodd C, Duarte-Salles T, Emborg HD, Gheorghe M, Kahlert J, Gini R, Huerta-Alvarez C, Martín-Merino E, McGee C, de Lusignan S, Picelli G, Roberto G, Tramontan L, Villa M, Weibel D, Titievsky L.
