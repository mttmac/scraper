Lists of indicator markers for RA were developed initially by panels of clinicians drawing up code-lists and then modified based on scrutiny of available data. The prevalence of indicator markers, and their temporal relationship to RA codes, was examined in patients from 3y before to 14d after recorded RA diagnosis.\n\n\nFindings: \n\nIndicator markers were common throughout EHRs of RA patients, with 83.5% having 2 or more markers. 34% of patients received a disease-specific prescription before RA was coded; 42% had a referral to rheumatology, and 63% had a test for rheumatoid factor. 65% had at least one joint symptom or sign recorded and in 44% this was at least 6-months before recorded RA diagnosis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Amanda Nicholson, Elizabeth Ford, Kevin A Davies, Helen E Smith, Greta Rait, A Rosemary Tate, Irene Petersen, Jackie Cassell, Optimising Use of Electronic Health Records to Describe the Presentation of Rheumatoid Arthritis in Primary Care A Strategy for Developing Code Lists.
