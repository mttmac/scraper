Analyses were stratified by gender, age group and practice-level Index of Multiple Deprivation quintile.\n\n\nFindings:\n\nIn April 2020, primary care-recorded incident depression reduced by 43·6% (95% CI 39·0% to 47·9%), anxiety disorders by 48·2% (CI 44·6% to 51·5%) and antidepressant prescribing by 36·2% (CI 33·7% to 38·6%) compared to expected rates based on prior trends. Reductions in first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders were particularly stark for working-age adults and patients registered at practices in more deprived areas. Self-harm incidence was 38·5% (CI 35·7% to 41·3%) lower than expected in April 2020. Total self-harm contacts fell by 28·2% (CI 25·5% to 30·8%). Rates of both incident and any self-harm remained around thirty percent lower than expected up to June 2020.\n\n\nInterpretation:\n\nOur findings reveal a stark treatment gap that was greater for first diagnoses of depression and anxiety disorders in working age adults, for practice populations in deprived areas, and for self-harm. Consequences could include more patients subsequently presenting with greater acuity and severity of mental illness and rising rates of non-fatal self-harm and suicide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Matthew J Carr, Sarah Steeg, Roger T Webb, Nav Kapur, Carolyn A Chew-Graham, Kathryn M Abel, Holly Hope, Matthias Pierce, Darren M.
