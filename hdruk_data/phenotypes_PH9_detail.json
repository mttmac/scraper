In light of\ncurrent debates on the U/J-shaped relationship observed between alcohol consumption and aggregated\nCVD outcomes10 five drinking categories were defined including: (1) non-drinkers (Read66 codes such\nas \"tee-total\" and \"non-drinkers\"), former drinkers (those with codes for \"stopped drinking alcohol\"\n\nand/or \"ex-drinker\"), occasional drinkers (those with codes for \"drinks rarely\" and/or \"drinks\noccasionally\"), current moderate drinkers (those who had a code for current alcohol consumer and an\nindicator of whether they drank within daily [32g or 24g of alcohol for men and women respectively]\n\nand/or weekly [168g of alcohol for men and 112g for women] recommended sensible drinking limits\nfor the UK at the time of observation69) and current heavy drinkers (defined as those who exceeded\ndaily and/or weekly sensible drinking limits). We also utilised data fields with information entered on\ndaily and/or weekly amount of alcohol consumed to define participants as non-drinkers, moderate\ndrinkers (drank within daily and/or weekly guidelines) and heavy drinkers. Weekly alcohol data was\navailable as a continuous variable, so we were able to classify consumption using standard thresholds\n\n\nData on daily alcohol intake was entered using categories of: (1) < 1\nUK unit (8 grams of ethanol), (2) 1-2 UK units, (3) 3-6 UK units, (4) 7-9 UK units, and (5) > 9 UK\nunits [Read codes 1362.00-1366.00], for which we defined moderate drinking as anything >1 UK\n\nunit but less than 3 (women) or 7 (men) UK units. Unfortunately information on binge drinking was\nonly available for a select minority of the cohort (~100 people) therefore a separate category for this\ndrinking behaviour was not defined (but these patients were coded as heavy drinkers). We reclassified\nnon-drinkers as former drinkers if they had any record of drinking recorded in their entire clinical\nrecord entered on CPRD prior to study entry (in cases whereby non-drinkers had no record of\ndrinking before entering the study we assumed that they were not former drinkers). This resulted in\n19,853 (out of 184,747; 10.7%) non-drinkers being recoded as former drinkers, a further 6,826 (3.7%)\n\nparticipants were reclassified through having a positive history of alcohol abuse.\n\n\n\n\nIn the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD, primary care data) we extracted information on alcohol consumption based on:\n\n- Clinician-recorded alcohol consumption information\n  - Stuctured data elements related to daily/weekly alcohol unit consumption\n  - Evidence of alcohol abuse\n  - Evidence of alcohol-related harm\n\n\n\n\n\nWe extracted alcohol unit intake information using the structured data part (entity type 5) of the additional table (units recorded in data2) field. We additionally extract information on intake through clinician-recorded classifications using Read terms (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018331","publication_link":"","source_reference":"https://portal.caliberresearch.org/phenotypes/alcohol-consumption","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"   PhenoFlow Implementation: https://kclhi.org/phenoflow/phenotype/download/34","publications":["Gho JMIH et al.
