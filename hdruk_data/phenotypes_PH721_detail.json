HbA1C variability was determined by standard deviation of ≥3 HbA1C results. Conditional logistic models were applied to determine association of HbA1C variability with first and recurrent HH.\n\n\nResults: \n\nIn T1D, every 1.0% increase in HbA1C variability was associated with 90% higher first HH risk (95% CI, 1.25–2.89) and 392% higher recurrent HH risk (95% CI, 1.17–20.61). In T2D, a 1.0% increase in HbA1C variability was associated with 556% higher first HH risk (95% CI, 3.88–11.08) and 573% higher recurrent HH risk (95% CI,1.59–28.51). In T2D for first HH, the association was the strongest in non-insulin non-sulfonylurea users (P b 0.0001); for recurrent HH, the association was stronger in insulin users than sulfonylurea users (P = 0.07). The HbA1C variability-HH association was stronger in more recent years in T2D (P ≤ 0.004).\n\n\nConclusions: \n\nHbA1C variability is a strong predictor for HH in T1D and T2D.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Victor W Zhong, Juhaeri Juhaeri, Stephen R Cole, Christian M Shay, Carolyn A Chew-Graham, Penny Gordon-Larsen, Evangelos Kontopantelis, Elizabeth J Mayer-Davis, HbA1C variability and hypoglycemia hospitalization in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes: A nested case-control study.
