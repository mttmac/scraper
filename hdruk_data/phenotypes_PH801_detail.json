The timely availability of laboratory test results during the episode of care could contribute to improved coding accuracy.The timely availability of laboratory test results during the episode of care could contribute to improved coding accuracy.Feemster et al, 2012We used Pediatric Health Information System data and laboratory records from 3 children's hospitals to determine whether administrative data accurately identify children with laboratory-confirmed influenza.The objective of this multicenter study was to validate influenza-specific ICD-9 codes for the identification of influenza cases among hospitalized childrenAmong 23 282 inpatients, diagnosis codes for influenza detected 73% of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, whereas <1% of patients without a diagnosis code had laboratory-confirmed influenza.Keren et al, 2006To determine the sensitivity and positive predictive value of influenza-specific ICD-9 admission or discharge codes (487.0, 487.1, and 487.8), we conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients <21 years of age hospitalized at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with laboratory-confirmed influenza during 3 consecutive influenza seasons (July 2001 through June 2004)Influenza-specific ICD-9 codes assigned in a setting of routine rapid diagnostic testing may be useful for following trends. However, these codes will substantially underestimate the actual number of influenza-related hospitalizations.","validation_performed":true,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"https://portal.caliberresearch.org/phenotypes/","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"\n\nThese codes are not intended to be mandatory, but are to be used as a starting point for the identification of influenza infection in routine Electronic Health Record (EHR). Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the National Health Service (NHS), Influenza is a common infectious viral illness spread by coughs and sneezes. Some of the main symptoms of influenza include: high temperature (fever) of 38C or above, tiredness and weakness, headache, general aches and pains and dry or chesty cough. Cold-like symptoms, such as a blocked or runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat, can also be caused by influenza, but they tend to be less severe than the other symptoms. \n\nhttps://www.nhsinform.scot/illnesses-and-conditions/infections-and-poisoning/flu\n\n \n\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, Influenza is an acute respiratory illness caused by RNA viruses f the family Orthomyxoviridae (influenza viruses). There are three types of influenza virus: Influenza A occurs more frequently and is more virulent. It is responsible for local outbreaks, larger epidemics and pandemics. Influenza B often co-circulates with influenza A during the yearly outbreaks. Generally, influenza B causes less severe clinical illness, although it can still be responsible for outbreaks.  Influenza C usually causes a mild or asymptomatic infection similar to the common cold.\n\nInfluenza presents with symptoms appearing around 2 days after exposure. Uncomplicated influenza signs and symptoms include: coryza, nasal discharge, cough, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, ocular symptoms, and sore throat. Complicated influenza is defined by signs and symptoms that: require hospital admission, involve the lower respiratory tract, central nervous system, or cause significant exacerbation of an underlying medical condition.\n\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/influenza-seasonal/\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["Publications in 2020-2021 identified in PubMed","Moss JWE, Davidson C, Mattock R, Gibbons I, Mealing S, Carroll S.
