Analyses evaluated the occurrence of 271 READ medical diagnostic codes, including categories for ‘Angina’, ‘Myocardial Infarction’, ‘Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting’ (CABG), ‘percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty’ (PCTA) and ‘Other Coronary Heart Disease’. Time-to-event analyses were implemented to evaluate occurrences of different groups of codes after the index date.\n\n\nResults: \n\nAmong 300,020 participants aged greater than 30 years there were 75,197 unique occurrences of coronary heart disease codes in 24,244 participants, with 12,495 codes for incident events and 62,702 for prevalent events. Among incident event codes, 3,607 (28.87%) were for angina, 3,262 (26.11%) were for MI, 514 (4.11%) for PCTA, 161 (1.29%) for CABG and 4,951 (39.62%) were for ‘Other CHD’. Among prevalent codes, 20,254 (32.30%) were for angina, 3,644 (5.81%) for MI, 34,542 (55.09%) for ‘Other CHD’ and 4,262 (6.80%) for CABG or PCTA. Among 3,685 participants initially diagnosed exclusively with ‘Other CHD’ codes, 17.1% were recorded with angina within 5 years, 5.6% with myocardial infarction, 6.3% with CABG and 8.6% with PCTA. From 2000 to 2010, the overall incidence of CHD declined, as did the incidence of angina, but the incidence of MI did not change. The frequency of CABG declined, while PCTA increased.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Nawarj Bhattarai, Judith Charlton, Caroline Rudisill, Martin C Gulliford, Coding, Recording and Incidence of Different Forms of Coronary Heart Disease in Primary Care.
