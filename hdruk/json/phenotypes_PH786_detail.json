It is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough resulting from acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways but with no evidence of pneumonia. It is therefore recommended that these codes are used for individuals with a respiratory tract infection restricted to trachea and large airways. \n\n \n\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/chest-infections-adult/background-information/definition/\n\nhttps://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/135\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["Publications in 2020-2021 identified in PubMed","Zhuo C, Wei X, Zhang Z, Hicks JP, Zheng J, Chen Z, Haldane V, Walley J, Guan Y, Xu H, Zhong N.
