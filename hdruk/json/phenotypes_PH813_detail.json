We looked for relevant codes in code repositories such as the University of Cambrigdge Primary Care Unit, Manchester Clinical Codes, HDR UK National Phenomics Resource Project, Oxford-RCGP RSC, OpenSAFELY and LSHTM Data Compass. We also searched for peer-reviewed studies published  via PubMed in the last 12 months for any relevant codes. Please note that these codes are not intended to be mandatory, but are to be used as a starting point for the identification of Sinusitis in routine electronic health record. Therefore, each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required. \n- No validations available","validation_performed":true,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"https://portal.caliberresearch.org/phenotypes/","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"\n\nAccording to NHS, sinusitis is swelling of the sinuses, usually caused by an infection.
