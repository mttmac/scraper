Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and the British Medical Journal (BMJ), Acute Bronchitis is defined as a lower respiratory tract infection which causes inflammation in the bronchial airways. It is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough resulting from acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways but with no evidence of pneumonia. It is therefore recommended that these codes are used for individuals with a respiratory tract infection restricted to trachea and large airways. \n\n \n\nhttps://cks.nice.org.uk/topics/chest-infections-adult/background-information/definition/\n\nhttps://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/135\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["Publications in 2020-2021 identified in PubMed","Zhuo C, Wei X, Zhang Z, Hicks JP, Zheng J, Chen Z, Haldane V, Walley J, Guan Y, Xu H, Zhong N.
