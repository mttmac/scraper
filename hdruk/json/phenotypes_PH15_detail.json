These codes are not intended to be mandatory, but are to be used as a starting point for the identification of pneumonia in routine EHR. Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.\n\n\nDefining a community-acquired pneumonia occurrence in CPRD and HES, Millett et al. 2013 used the following algorithm:\n\n1) Pneumonia records wtihin 28 days of each other were considered to be separate consultations for the same illness\n2) First record of pneumonia was the index date\n3) End of a pneumonia occurrence was defined as 28 days after the last pneumonia code within the illness episode\n4) In HES, pneumonia coded as the primary diagnosis on the first day of a hospital admission\n\n\nDefining a hospital-acquired pneumonia occurrence in HES and CPRD, Millett et al. 2013 used the following algorithm:\n\n1) Pneumonia coded at any time beyond the first day of a hospital admission\n2) Using CPRD in conjunction with HES, pneumonia coded in CPRD within 14 days of a hospital admission (for any cause) was deemed hospital-acquired\n3) In CPRD, use of a hospital-acquired pneumonia code at any time during the pneumonia occurrence\n\n\nMillett, E.
