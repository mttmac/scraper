We looked for relevant codes in code repositories such as the University of Cambrigdge Primary Care Unit, Manchester Clinical Codes, HDR UK National Phenomics Resource Project, Oxford-RCGP RSC, OpenSAFELY and LSHTM Data Compass. We also searched for peer-reviewed studies published  via PubMed in the last 12 months for any relevant codes. Please note that these codes are not intended to be mandatory, but are to be used as a starting point for the identification of Trancheitis in routine electronic health record. Therefore, each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required. \n- No validation available","validation_performed":true,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"https://portal.caliberresearch.org/phenotypes/","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["No publications idenified via Pubmed in the last 12 months "],"concepts":[{"name":"Trancheitis Secondary care -  2","concept_id":"C2565","concept_version_id":6530,"coding_system":"ICD11 codes","codes":[{"code":"CA05.1","description":"Acute tracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"CA05.2","description":"Acute laryngotracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"CA05.Z","description":"Acute laryngitis or tracheitis, unspecified","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"CA0G","description":"Chronic laryngitis or laryngotracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"}]},{"name":"Trancheitis Secondary care -  1","concept_id":"C2564","concept_version_id":6528,"coding_system":"ICD10 codes","codes":[{"code":"J04","description":"Acute laryngitis and tracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"J04.1","description":"Acute tracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"J04.2","description":"Acute laryngotracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"J37","description":"Chronic laryngitis and laryngotracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"},{"code":"J37.1","description":"Chronic laryngotracheitis","BREATHE recommended":"Y"}]},{"name":"Trancheitis Secondary care - BREATHE recommended - 2","concept_id":"C2563","concept_version_id":6526,"coding_system":"ICD11 codes","codes":[{"code":"CA05.1","description":"Acute tracheitis"},{"code":"CA05.2","description":"Acute laryngotracheitis"},{"code":"CA05.Z","description":"Acute laryngitis or tracheitis, unspecified"},{"code":"CA0G","description":"Chronic laryngitis or laryngotracheitis"}]},{"name":"Trancheitis Secondary care - BREATHE recommended - 1","concept_id":"C2562","concept_version_id":6524,"coding_system":"ICD10 codes","codes":[{"code":"J04","description":"Acute laryngitis and tracheitis"},{"code":"J04.1","description":"Acute tracheitis"},{"code":"J04.2","description":"Acute laryngotracheitis"},{"code":"J37","description":"Chronic laryngitis and laryngotracheitis"},{"code":"J37.1","description":"Chronic laryngotracheitis"}]}],"versions":[{"version_id":2251,"version_name":"Trancheitis Secondary care","version_date":"2022-08-04T18:56:52.300320Z","is_published":true,"is_latest":true},{"version_id":1713,"version_name":"Trancheitis Secondary care","version_date":"2022-01-21T07:12:08.500641Z","is_published":true,"is_latest":false}]}]
