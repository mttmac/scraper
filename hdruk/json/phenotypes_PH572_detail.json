The overall crude rate of AKI was 6.4/1,000 person years at risk (95% CI 6.30 to 6.50) but varied from 1.63 (1.43 to 1.86) to 662.53 (538.98 to 814.40) depending on, age, comorbidities, and other prescribed drugs. The adjusted RR of AKI during time exposed to ACEI/ARB compared to time unexposed was 1.18 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.23) which was attenuated to 1.12 (95% CI 1.08 to 1.17) after adjustment for non-thiazide diuretic therapy. There was an interaction for the risk of AKI between people using loop diuretics and ACEI/ARB. For those taking loop diuretics, the adjusted RR of AKI during time exposed to ACEI/ARB compared to time unexposed was 0.99 (95% CI 0.92 to 1.06) but it was 1.18 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.24) among people not-exposed to loop diuretics (p<0.001).\n\n\nConclusions: \n\nTreatment with ACEI/ARB alone appears to be associated with a small increase in the rate of AKI which is largely seen among people with low absolute risk of AKI. Among people requiring loop diuretics, who have a high absolute risk of AKI, treatment with ACEI/ARB had no measurable association with AKI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Kethryn E
