A cohort study with 48,523 patients with psoriasis and 208,187 controls was conducted. During a median follow-up of 5.2 years, 1,257 patients with psoriasis (2.59%) had a major CV event, compared with 4,784 controls (2.30%). In the multivariable analysis, inflammatory arthritis hazard ratio (HR) 1.36 (1.18–1.58), diabetes HR 1.18 (1.06–1.31), chronic kidney disease HR 1.18 (1.07–1.31), hypertension HR 1.37 (1.29–1.45), transient ischemic attack HR 2.74 (2.41–3.12), atrial fibrillation HR 1.54 (1.36–1.73), valvular heart disease HR 1.23 (1.05–1.44), thromboembolism 1.32 (1.17–1.49), congestive heart failure HR 1.57 (1.39–1.78), depression HR 1.16 (1.01–1.34), current smoker HR 2.18 (2.03–2.33), age (year) HR 1.07 (1.07–1.07), and male gender HR 1.83 (1.69–1.98) were statistically significant for the risk of major CV events. The age- and genderadjusted HRs of a major CV event for psoriasis were 1.10 (1.04–1.17) and for severe psoriasis 1.40 (1.07–1.84), whereas the fully adjusted HRs were attenuated to 1.02 (0.95–1.08) and 1.28 (0.96–1.69). In conclusion, neither psoriasis nor severe psoriasis were associated with the short-to-medium term (over 3–5 years) risk of major CV events after adjusting for known cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Rosa Parisi, Martin K Rutter, Mark Lunt, Helen S Young, Deborah P M Symmons, Christopher E M Griffiths, Darren M.
