The coded diagnoses of pleural empyema is defined as J86-, also known as pyothorax.  Empyema was considered as a pleural effusion that had a documented pH of less than 7.2, microscopic evidence of infection, or frank pus. If microscopic evidence was not available, then clear clinical management as empyema (supporting radiology, clinical progress, and biochemistry) was used.The clinical diagnosis of empyema was made on retrospective review of the notes, discharge summary, radiology, and microbiology available.Empyema was considered as a pleural effusion that had a documented pH of less than 7.2, microscopic evidence of infection, or frank pus. If microscopic evidence was not available, then clear clinical management as empyema (supporting radiology, clinical progress, and biochemistry) was used.Empyema coding was generally good (>85% accuracy), although some cases were miscoded. Using codes for elective admissions helped to differentiate post-operative from community acquired empyema. It is likely empyema is under rather than over-recorded in HES data.Using codes for elective admissions helped to differentiate post-operative from community acquired empyema.

Each study may differ in the sensitivity and specificity of the coding required.  \n\n \n\nAccording to the National Health Service (NHS), Empyema is defined as pocketcs of pus that have collected insided a body cavity. They can form if a bacterial infection is left untreated, or if it fails to fully respond to treatment. The term is most commonly used to refer to pus-filled pockets that develop in the pleural space.\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/conditions/empyema/\n\nNot found code search\n\n","publications":["Publications in 2020-2021 identified in PubMed","Arnold DT, Hamilton FW, Morris TT, Suri T, Morley A, Frost V, Vipond IB, Medford AR, Payne RA, Muir P, Maskell NA.
