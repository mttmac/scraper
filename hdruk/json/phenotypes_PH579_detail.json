Patients already taking statins were more likely to stop taking them for both primary and secondary prevention after the high media coverage period (1.11 (1.05 to 1.18; P<0.001) and 1.12 (1.04 to 1.21; P=0.003), respectively). Stratified analyses showed that older patients and those with a longer continuous prescription were more likely to stop taking statins after the media coverage. In post hoc analyses, the increased rates of cessation were no longer observed after six months.\n\n\nConclusions:\n\nA period of intense public discussion over the risks: benefit balance of statins, covered widely in the media, was followed by a transient rise in the proportion of people who stopped taking statins. This research highlights the potential for widely covered health stories in the lay media to impact on healthcare related behaviour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Anthony Mathews, Emily Herret, Antonio Gassparrini, Tjeerd Van Staa, Ben Goldacre, Liam Smeeth, Krishnan Bhaskaran, Impact of statin related media coverage on use of statins interrupted time series analysis with UK primary care data.
