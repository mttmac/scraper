Time-varying smoking status, years of cessation, and amount smoked were determined frompatientsâ€™medical records. The date and underlying cause of deathwere identified by linkagewith Office for National Statistics records. The associations between smoking status and smoking cessation with all-cause and causespecific mortality (circulatory disease, all cancers, lung cancer, respiratory disease, and respiratory infection) were investigated using adjusted Cox (all-causemortality) and Fine-Gray (cause-specificmortality) regression.\n\n\nResults: \n\nThe cohort comprised 5,677 patients (median age 61.4 years, 68% women), with 40% as never smokers, 34% former smokers, and 26% current smokers at baseline. Compared to never smoking, current smokingwas associated with an increased risk of all-causemortality (hazard ratio 1.98 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.56, 2.53]), andmortality due to circulatory disease (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.96 [95% CI 1.33, 2.90]) and lung cancer (SHR 23.2 [95% CI 5.15, 105]). Each year of smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (former heavy smokers SHR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77, 0.94], former light smokers SHR 0.90 [95%CI 0.84, 0.97]).\n\n\nConclusion: \n\nCurrent smoking is associated with an increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and lung cancermortality in patientswith RA. Each year of cessation is associated with a reduced risk of all-causemortality. This information may prove helpful in smoking cessation programs for patients with RA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","validation_performed":false,"publication_doi":"","publication_link":"","source_reference":"","citation_requirements":"","implementation":"","publications":["Rebecca M Joseph, Mohammad Movahedi, William G Dixon, Deborah P M Symmons, Smoking-Related Mortality in Patients With Early Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Retrospective Cohort Study Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink.
